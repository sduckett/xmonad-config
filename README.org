#+Title: Finding the Flow with XMonad
#+Author: Sean Duckett
#+EPRESENT_FRAME_LEVEL: 1

* Goals
First, I'd like to update my keybindings. I really like hitting chords on the
keyboard to play with the computer.


Secondly, I'd like to turn the configuration file into literate haskell. This is
to see if I can understand Haskell after some time away, my ideas of what it
meant to be an unobtrusive window manager, and what tasks & tools I regularly
use.


* Dependencies
   - ghc
   - xmonad
* Building
It's a basic Haskell workflow:
1. cd ~/.xmonad/
1. ghc --make xmonad.hs
1. xmonad --restart

Or, you can use =xmonad --recompile= and =xmonad --restart= to get it done from
dmenu.
